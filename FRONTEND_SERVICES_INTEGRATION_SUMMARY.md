# Frontend Services Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete integration of all refactored microservices into the frontend, including API gateway routing and frontend service APIs.

## API Gateway Integration

### 1. Proxy Routes Created
- ✅ `api-gateway/src/routes/auth-proxy.ts` - Auth service proxy
- ✅ `api-gateway/src/routes/buyer-proxy.ts` - Buyer service proxy  
- ✅ `api-gateway/src/routes/seller-proxy.ts` - Seller service proxy
- ✅ `api-gateway/src/routes/admin-proxy.ts` - Admin service proxy
- ✅ `api-gateway/src/routes/superadmin-proxy.ts` - Super Admin service proxy
- ✅ `api-gateway/src/routes/investor-proxy.ts` - Investor service proxy
- ✅ `api-gateway/src/routes/loan-proxy.ts` - Loan service proxy
- ✅ `api-gateway/src/routes/agent-proxy.ts` - Agent service proxy

### 2. API Gateway Configuration
- ✅ Updated `api-gateway/src/config/services.ts` with all service URLs
- ✅ Updated `api-gateway/src/index.ts` to include all proxy routers
- ✅ Added feature flags in `shared/config/featureFlagTypes.ts`

### 3. Service Ports Configuration
```typescript
// Service URLs configured in api-gateway/src/config/services.ts
auth: "http://localhost:8000"
buyer: "http://localhost:8001" 
seller: "http://localhost:8014"
admin: "http://localhost:8016"
superadmin: "http://localhost:8017"
investor: "http://localhost:8018"
agent: "http://localhost:8015"
loan: "http://localhost:8013"
payment: "http://localhost:8017"
```

## Frontend Service APIs

### 1. Service API Files Created
- ✅ `frontend/src/services/auth.api.ts` - Authentication service
- ✅ `frontend/src/services/buyer.api.ts` - Buyer service
- ✅ `frontend/src/services/seller.api.ts` - Seller service
- ✅ `frontend/src/services/admin.api.ts` - Admin service
- ✅ `frontend/src/services/superadmin.api.ts` - Super Admin service
- ✅ `frontend/src/services/agent.api.ts` - Agent service
- ✅ `frontend/src/services/investor.api.ts` - Investor service
- ✅ `frontend/src/services/loan.api.ts` - Loan service

### 2. Main API Client Integration
- ✅ Updated `frontend/src/services/api-client.ts` with all service endpoints
- ✅ Added comprehensive service methods for each microservice
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing endpoints

## Summary

All 8 refactored microservices have been successfully integrated into both the API Gateway and Frontend:

1. **API Gateway**: Proxy routes created and configured for all services
2. **Frontend**: Comprehensive service APIs with React Query hooks
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
4. **Feature Gating**: Role-based access control and Pro feature gating
5. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling across all services
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved

The integration provides a solid foundation for the MSMEBazaar platform with proper separation of concerns, type safety, and scalable architecture.
